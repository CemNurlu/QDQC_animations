# QDQC Animations

This repository contains files to generate animations associated to lectures and projects in the course _Qubit Dynamics and Quantum Control_ (QDQC) at the Technical University of Delft.

## Repository structure

The different modules in the repository are:

### anim_base

Contains classes and functions that is ( or could be ) used for several different animations.

- __anim_objects.py__ Class objects and functions used to render animations
- __util.py__ Miscellaneous utility functions
- __config.py__ Configuration file for the animations. Here you can set the file type and font for the animations.
- __spin2D.py__ Contains the 2D spin object. Could be moved to anim_objects.py

### anim_scripts

Contains scripts that generate the animations. All these scripts imports the classes and functions from the __anim_base__ module. The scripts are structured after the lectures that they are associated with. Sometimes also in subfolders. It could be an idea to also add folders associated with the projects.

- __run_all_animations.py__ Script that runs all the animations in the repository ( in a somewhat hacky way...). Not tested rigorously, so use with caution. Could be useful for checking that your machine can run all the animations. Also if you want to change some general configuration in __config.py__, you can run this script to regenerate all the animations.

### animations

Contains the animations generated by the scripts in __anim_scripts__. Folders here should be structured exactly as in __anim_scripts__. 

The process of designing the animations is usually iterative, so we save the animations in a folder __test__ while debugging/tweaking. When satisfied with the animation, we move it to the appropriate Lecture folder ( or subfolder ). When you are done with an animation, you can also include it in the README.md file to show it in the repository.

__NOTE:__ gif files are extremely much heavier than mp4 files, and should only be saved locally. They are therefore included in the _.gitignore_ file, which makes sure they are never uploaded to the remote repository.

## Animation Overview

As mentioned above, gif files are to heavy to be uploaded to the remote repository. The much lighter mp4 files are uploaded, but can not be viewed directly in the README.md file. If you want to see a nice overview, there is an easy way to do this if you work in VS Code.

1. Install an extension which can render markdown files, for example [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)
2. Generate the gif files from the mp4 files by running the script `animations.make_gif_copies.py`. This will generate the gif files in the __animations__ folder.
3. Open the README.md file in VS Code. You can now see the animations in the preview window.
